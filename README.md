# Pollinators

Pollinators is a React SPA showcasing a small group of local wildlife.

## Description

Pollinators is a small list of insects that help diversify our eco system and pollinate our flowers and food sources.  In addition to the bugs themselves, you will find a native range where they are indigenous and also the flowers that will most likely attract them to your yard or garden.  As this is only a small list, there is a form you can submit to add your favorite insect.
